# Celo-Specific Security Patterns

> **Scope:** risks that are **unique to Celo** and not generally covered by chain-agnostic audit skills. For general Solidity auditing (static analysis, threat modeling, invariants, fuzz testing, access control, math precision), use the **Pashov Audit Group skills**: https://github.com/pashov/skills
>
> Specifically: `solidity-auditor` (8-agent parallel audit) and `x-ray` (threat model / attack surface generation).
>
> This file is a **minimal stub**, not a full audit playbook. Each risk below names the failure mode and a rough mitigation; several include **⚠️ Unverified specifics** tags — verify against primary sources before shipping authoritative guidance.

## 1. CELO token duality

**Risk:** CELO exists on two transport paths simultaneously — native (`msg.value`) and ERC-20 at `0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438`. Contracts that treat the same user action as crediting through both paths produce double-count accounting. Contracts that reject one path when the target function expects the other silently lose funds.

**Detection:**
- Search each entry point for both `msg.value > 0` handling and `IERC20(CELO).transferFrom(...)`.
- If both can credit the same balance, confirm the two paths are tracked in separate state or explicitly mutually exclusive.

**Mitigation:**
- Pick one path per entry point. If you must accept both, track them in separate balances or unify at a single authoritative entry.
- Never assume `address(this).balance` alone captures CELO deposits — aggregate with `IERC20(CELO).balanceOf(address(this))` if both paths are live.

## 2. Fee abstraction (CIP-64) abuse

**Risk:** With `feeCurrency` set, gas is paid in a whitelisted ERC-20 — including tokens your contract also accepts as payment. A user's transaction can both debit a balance inside your contract **and** pay gas in the same token, out-of-band. If your accounting assumes `msg.sender`'s balance is stable across the call, that assumption can fail.

**⚠️ Unverified specifics — check before shipping:**
- CIP-64 ([spec](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0064.md)) defines the tx type and encoding but **does not explicitly state whether the `feeCurrency` debit runs before, during, or after the main call, or whether unused gas is refunded in the fee currency**. Confirm this against current Celo client behavior before writing authoritative mitigations.
- The CIP refers back to CIP-42 for security considerations without restating them.

**Rough rule:**
- Never assume `msg.sender`'s token balance at the start of a function equals their balance at the end, even without your contract touching it — the fee-currency deduction happens outside your code.
- If you rely on balance-delta invariants (e.g. "this call must transfer exactly `x` tokens from the caller"), assert them with `balanceOf` snapshots taken inside your call, not from pre-call state.

## 3. Aave V3 aToken ratio drift

**Risk:** aToken balance is **not** 1:1 with the underlying — it scales with `liquidityIndex` as interest accrues. Contracts that treat `aToken.balanceOf(x)` as "x's underlying position" produce incorrect share math, incorrect redemption amounts, and (over long horizons) increasingly skewed accounting.

**⚠️ Unverified specifics — check before shipping:**
- Exact conversion math lives in Aave V3's `ReserveLogic` / `WadRayMath` libraries. Verify the current formula against the Aave V3 docs (`https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool`) before relying on any snippet here.

**Mitigation:**
- Store positions as `scaledBalanceOf` (index-normalized) — not raw `balanceOf`. Convert to underlying only at the moment of display/withdrawal via the current reserve index.
- For UIs: fetch fresh data via `UIPoolDataProvider` (see `defi-protocols.md` → _Fetching Live APY_).

## 4. Mento circuit breaker risk

**Risk:** Mento stablecoin pools (USDm, EURm, BRLm, GBPm, etc.) use per-pool price-deviation **circuit breakers** that halt swaps when the live price diverges too far from a reference / EMA, or when oracle data goes stale. A protocol that assumes always-available Mento mint/redeem can freeze user funds during breaker cooldowns.

**What is known** (from Mento v3 docs, `https://docs.mento.org/mento-v3/dive-deeper/fpmm/oracles-and-circuit-breakers`):
- Breakers are **binary** — trading is either allowed or halted for that feed; they do not throttle.
- When tripped, **swaps and quotes halt** on affected pools. Adding/removing liquidity in existing pools may remain possible.
- Resets require a **cooldown period plus normalized conditions**; thresholds and cooldowns are governance-configured.
- FX-priced pools (EURm/USDm, GBPm/USDm) are most exposed to market-hours gating; USDC/USDm is less affected.

**⚠️ Unverified specifics — check before shipping:**
- Exact threshold values, cooldown durations, and the full list of gated pools change via governance. Always read the live config, not this file.

**Mitigation:**
- Design withdrawal paths that don't require hitting Mento atomically. Consider fallback liquidity (Uniswap, Curve) or time-delayed queues.
- For critical user flows, detect breaker state before quoting and surface it in the UI.

## 5. Epoch boundary effects (post-L2 migration)

**Risk:** Post-L2 migration (block 31,056,500, 2025-03-26), epoch processing moved from the geth client to an `EpochManager` smart contract. Contracts that read staking-related balances or validator state at epoch boundaries may see non-atomic or mid-transition state.

**What is known** (from the Celo L2 migration spec, `https://specs.celo.org/l2_migration.html`):
- Epoch processing, rewards distribution, and elected-validator storage are handled by the `EpochManager` contract.
- Only a subset of legacy epoch functions were ported: `getEpochNumberOfBlock()`, `getEpochNumber()`, `validatorSignerAddressFromCurrentSet()`, `numberValidatorsInCurrentSet()`.

**⚠️ Unverified specifics — check before shipping:**
- **Epoch duration** post-L2 is not stated in the spec page above — confirm against current `EpochManager` configuration or release notes.
- Whether epoch state changes are atomic-within-one-block or spread across multiple blocks is **not documented on the linked spec page**. Don't assume atomicity without verification.

**Mitigation:**
- For staking / validator / reward math, prefer reading from `EpochManager` directly rather than inferring from validator balances or total supply.
- If your logic depends on atomic balance snapshots, don't rely on values read in the same block as an epoch transition — add a buffer or cross-check with the previous epoch's finalized state.

## Using this file with pashov/skills

For any Celo deployment, run all three layers:

1. **pashov/skills `solidity-auditor`** → chain-agnostic security coverage (math precision, access control, economic security, invariants, first principles, execution trace).
2. **pashov/skills `x-ray`** → threat model, actors, trust boundaries, attack surfaces, data flow.
3. **This file** → Celo-specific risks layered on top.
